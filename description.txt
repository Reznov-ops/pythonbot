My bot does nothing harmful, he only needs permission to write and have access to your text channels so that he can reply back. You can say a command like "mikasa" and he'll give you a beautiful gif to make your day. He doesn't have a prefix so whenever someone types one of it's commands he will surprise you! Trust me you will love it. That's what my uncle said :/ He's from BO2, but I guess you already knew that!? Here are some of the commands so that I don't spoil them all: mikasa, aot, kaneki, touka, cat, dog, quote, eminem. Remember! He's still a work in progress :)
